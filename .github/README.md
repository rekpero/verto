## About

This is the front-end/app for the PST exchange service. It is built in Svelte(Sapper), JS and TS. We use the export feature of Sapper to create an arweave-deployable app.

You can access the code for trading posts [here](https://github.com/useverto/trading-post).

## Guide

To build/use the service on localhost, you will have to download Node, and install the yarn package manager (`npm i -g yarn`). When you have these, clone this repository and run `yarn install` to add the required dependencies. 
Below, you will see the available commands to test/build the project.

### Libraries

We use the arweave-js library with Svelte/Sapper. You can read more about these in their github repos.

### Debug

This will start the app with live reload, according to the rollup config
```sh
yarn run dev
```

### Export

This will export the app to static html/css/js to `__sapper__/export`
```sh
yarn run export
```
